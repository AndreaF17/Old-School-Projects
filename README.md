# Old-School-Projects

This repository is a personal archive of small projects, exercises and course assignments created during High School and University. It contains short demos and student projects in several languages and formats — useful as examples, learning references, or nostalgic review.

## What you'll find here

- High School: a collection of projects organized by subject and language (Assembly, C#, C++, MySQL, simple websites). Many are homework or small exercises made while learning basics.
- UNI: university projects and course work including Java, concurrent/distributed programming exercises, small apps (e.g., CookingApp), and systems/OS exercises.

Top-level layout (selected):

- `High School/ITS J.M Keynes/Assembly/` — assembly examples (e.g. `assembly_hello_world.asm`).

- `High School/Java Projects/` — assorted Java exercises and lab assignments.
- `UNI/Esame-Programmazione-Concorrente-e-distribuita/` — Java files for concurrent/distributed programming assignments (servers, clients, buffers, publishers/subscribers).
- `UNI/CookingApp/` — a small app with source and design notes (contains a nested project folder).
- `UNI/FoodAdvisor/` and `UNI/FoodAdvisor_Console/` — older app projects with source, docs and data folders.
- `UNI/Progetto-Lab-B/` — a larger project with server and SQL subfolders.
- `UNI/Sistemi-Operativi-Esercizi-Semafori/` — algorithmic exercises for operating systems course.
